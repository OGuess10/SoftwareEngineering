For this assignment, I chose to assess the ethical quandries and systems associated with a retailer selling
your personal information to others for profit. For the first ethical quandry, the consumer system should 
be affected by the knowledge of the individual, since the individual is a consumer and thus is part of the 
consumer system. The type of information that is sold affects the technical system because data is being 
transferred. It also affects the consumer system because the consumer is giving the data, and it affects
the seller system because the retailer is selling this data for profit. What kind of companies means the
ethical reasons a company is purchasing this information. This affects the social system because the company's
decisions can affect products, advertisements, and many other social aspects. It affects the seller system
because the retailer is selling to a company, making transactions between them.

The affects to individuals quandry affects the consumer system, because an individual is impacted by their
purchase at a retailer. The affects to retailer system, however, affects both the consumer and seller system
since they are both receiving data from consumers and selling this data to other companies. The affects to
the general public affects the social system, because the way companies use this data can impact the public.
